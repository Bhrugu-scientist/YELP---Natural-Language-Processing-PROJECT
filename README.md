# YELP---Natural-Language-Processing-PROJECT

-  Classified the Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews. Pipeline method is used.

- Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.

- The "stars" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) 

- The "cool" column is the number of "cool" votes this review received from other Yelp users.

- All reviews start with 0 "cool" votes, and there is no limit to how many "cool" votes a review can receive. 

- The "useful" and "funny" columns are similar to the "cool" column.
